When we talk about the search for a name’s value in relation to code, the term scope refers to a namespace: that is, the location of a name’s assignment in your source code determines the scope of the name’s visibility to your code.\n","\n","The place where you assign a name in your source code determines the namespace it will live in, and hence its scope of visibility.\n","\n","- Names assigned inside a def can only be seen by the code within that def. You cannot even refer to such names from outside the function.\n","\n","- Names assigned inside a def do not clash with variables outside the def, even if the same names are used elsewhere. A name X assigned outside a given def (i.e., in a different def or at the top level of a module file) is a completely different variable from a name X assigned inside that def."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"Uofb9BxuKhZz"},"outputs":[],"source":["x = 1990\n","\n","def func():\n","    x = 2020\n","    print(x)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"8MWEcjOFKhZz"},"outputs":[],"source":["func()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"oIGgQH4zKhZz"},"outputs":[],"source":["x"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"941hAmYzKhZ0"},"source":["- If you need to assign a name that lives at the top level of the module enclosing the function, you can do so by declaring it in a global statement inside the function. \n","\n","- If you need to assign a name that lives in an enclosing def, as of Python 3.X you can do so by declaring it in a nonlocal statement."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"D3x5_79tKhZ0"},"source":["Type of assignment within a function classifies a name as local.
